# Project assignment Winter Call

## Abstract


## Problem overview

-dataset
- we have to build a regression model(two outputs)
- metric we are evalutated on
- how data is obtained
- there are no empty/Nan values
- show an example of the pmax. On the pads there are no measures

## Proposed approach
### Preprocessing
- which type of field carry useful information
- triangle
- outlier (explain the two approaches)
- max pmax
- check feature correlation (?)
- advantages

### Model selection
- which models we have tested (possibly link to papers)
### Hyperparameters tuning
- hyperparameters tuning
- table with what we have tried


## Results
- what we got from the tuning and the various steps in the choices  
- mean error for each cell. Maybe some positions are harder to predict
- naive solution


## Discussion
- comparison with a naive solution
- comparison with the two regressors we tune
- what can be done more(use NN) do more gridsearccv tests(explain the time limit)
