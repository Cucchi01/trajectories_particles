# Trajectories particles
##Data Science Lab Project

For this project, we developed a regression pipeline to predict the position of a particle passing through a flat sensor, specifically estimating the x-y coordinates on this surface.

To make these predictions, we utilized data collected from multiple types of sensors. The initial phase of the project focused on feature analysis and preprocessing. In the next phase, we evaluated multiple models to determine the best fit for the task. The models tested were Random Forest, Extra Trees Regressor, and Voting Regressor.

Our solution's implementation, along with various test functions, is located in the '\script' directory. The methodology, results, and detailed analysis are documented in the "report.pdf" file.
